# Coanda-Jet-Image-Boundary-Extraction-Application-
This repository is devoted to applications that take a schlieren image of a Coanda Jet and extract the boundary as a set of points. 
The boundary coordinates are saved in a csv. The current iteration uses Canny Edge detection to find the boundary.

This video shows how to use the program.
